Purpose
=======

Pretty much every utility stuff you could imagine is already written down in some python package.
But almost every time these stuff is part of a heavyweight framework with a lots of
dependencies. And on top they do it in a slightly different way - you would do it - because it
is tailored to their needs.

This is why I made up this `Yet Another Utility Package` called `pytoolkit42`.
I want this `toolkit` to be

* lightweight and
* easy to use

Right now it does not have the answer to every problem you will encounter, but it serves
well to solve problems I stumble upon on a regular basis.

The collection of functions, classes, decorator, mixins will grow when I come up with a
solution that seems to be of use for everybody else out there.

But to be honest: I try to make this package as generic as possible so it might be useful to you,
but I cannot promise. Nevertheless you are encouraged to make PRs.
